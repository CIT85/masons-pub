  <h2>What is a Habitat?</h2>
  <p>A habitat is the natural environment where a plant or animal lives. Habitats provide food, water, shelter, and space needed for survival. Different species have adapted to live in specific environments, from freezing mountains to hot deserts and deep oceans.</p>

  <p>
    Habitat and ecosystems are closely connected, but they’re not the same thing.

    <article>
      <h3>Forest Habitat</h3>
      <p>Forests are filled with trees, plants, insects, and animals such as squirrels, deer, and owls. They have different layers like the canopy and forest floor, which support many species. Forests provide oxygen and store carbon, making them vital to life on Earth.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Ocean Habitat</h3>
      <p>Oceans cover about 70% of Earth’s surface and are home to fish, dolphins, whales, coral reefs, and countless other creatures. Many species depend on underwater plants and algae for food and oxygen. Coral reefs in particular are biodiversity hotspots that support thousands of marine species.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Desert Habitat</h3>
      <p>Deserts are hot and dry with little rainfall. Animals like camels, lizards, and foxes survive by conserving water and staying cool during the day. Many desert species are nocturnal, meaning they are active at night when temperatures are lower.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Grassland Habitat</h3>
      <p>Grasslands are open areas dominated by grasses and scattered trees. They support large herbivores like bison, elephants, and zebras, as well as predators such as lions and cheetahs. These habitats often experience seasonal rainfall and fires that help maintain balance in the ecosystem.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Tundra Habitat</h3>
      <p>The tundra is a cold, treeless region found in the Arctic and high mountain areas. The ground remains frozen most of the year (permafrost). Animals like caribou, arctic foxes, and snowy owls have adapted to survive extreme cold and short growing seasons.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Freshwater Habitat</h3>
      <p>Freshwater habitats include rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands. These areas provide clean water and are home to frogs, fish, beavers, and insects. Freshwater systems are crucial for both wildlife and humans, supporting drinking water, agriculture, and ecosystems.</p>
