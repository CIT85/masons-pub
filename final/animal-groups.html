    <h2>Understanding Animal Groups</h2>
    <p>Animals are classified into different groups based on shared characteristics. These groups help scientists study how animals live, grow, and interact with their environments. Below are the six major animal groups found in nature. Each type has special features that make it unique and important to ecosystems around the world.</p>

      <h3 id="mammals">Mammals</h3>
      <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals that usually have hair and produce milk for their young. They breathe air through lungs and maintain a constant body temperature. Examples include tigers, elephants, whales, and humans.</p>

    <article>
      <h3 id="birds">Birds</h3>
      <p>Birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. Most birds can fly, but some like penguins and ostriches cannot. They lay hard-shelled eggs and play vital roles in pollination, seed dispersal, and insect control.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3 id="reptiles">Reptiles</h3>
      <p>Reptiles are cold-blooded and covered in scales or tough skin. They lay soft-shelled eggs and often live in warm environments. Common examples include snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3 id="amphibians">Amphibians</h3>
      <p>Amphibians live both in water and on land during different stages of life. They have moist skin that helps them breathe. Examples include frogs, toads, salamanders, and axolotls.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3 id="fish">Fish</h3>
      <p>Fish are aquatic animals that breathe through gills and use fins to swim. They are cold-blooded and come in a wide range of shapes and sizes—from tiny seahorses to giant manta rays and sharks.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3 id="invertebrates">Invertebrates</h3>
      <p>Invertebrates are animals without backbones and make up about 97% of all animal species. This group includes insects, spiders, mollusks, and crustaceans. The monarch butterfly and octopus are two famous examples.</p>
