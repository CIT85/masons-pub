    <h2>Purpose of This Site</h2>
    <p>Wildlife Discovery was created to help people learn more about animal groups, habitats, and endangered species. The goal is to present information in a simple and visually clear way so anyone can quickly understand how different animals live and how ecosystems connect.</p>

    <h2>Who is this site for?</h2>
    <p>This site is for students, nature enthusiasts, and anyone curious about wildlife. It’s written so that anyone — even without background knowledge — can learn something new about animals and their environments.</p>

    <h2>What inspired me to create this?</h2>
    <p>I chose this topic because I enjoy learning about animals and nature. Building this website let me practice my HTML and CSS skills while creating something educational that others could use.</p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>In the future, I’d like to add more animal profiles, interactive maps, and small features that make the site more engaging. As I learn more web development, I also plan to include simple JavaScript features to improve the experience.</p>
